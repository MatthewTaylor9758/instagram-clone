## Instagram Overview
Instagram is based on the real web-based Instagram site, focused on helping connect people and share photos and videos!
</br>
</br>
The front end was built using HTML, CSS, and the Pug library, while the back end was developed using the Sequelize.js ORM, and PostgreSQL.
</br>
</br>
Users can look at all of the pictures they have posted, the ones their friends have in the main feed, and leave comments if they wish.

## Application Architecture

## Front End Overview
### Pug
Pug is the template engine we used through the entire front end for its ability to natively use Javascript and convert the code seamlessly into HTML that the browser can parse.
</br>
</br>
### CSS
Using CSS and its many features we were able to acheive the look we desired. We took advantage of basic CSS features such as z-index, box-sizing, and overflow and integrated them with more advanced features such as the ever-handy Flexbox.

## Back End Overview
### Sequelize ORM
We decided to use the Sequelize.js library for its ease of use when creating models, migrations and seeder files. Sequelize helped streamline our interactions with the database in all facets, such as creating a model for users as the code below shows:
```
"use strict";
const { Model } = require("sequelize");
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  class User extends Model {

    validatePassword(password) {
      return bcrypt.compareSync(password, this.password.toString());
    }
    
    static associate(models) {
      User.hasMany(models.Relationship, {
        foreignKey: "userId",
        otherKey: "relatedUserId",
      });
      User.hasMany(models.Picture, {
        foreignKey: "userId",
      });
      User.hasMany(models.Comment, {
        foreignKey: "userId",
      });
      User.hasMany(models.Like, {
        foreignKey: "userId",
      });
    }
  }
  User.init(
    {
      userName: DataTypes.STRING,
      email: DataTypes.STRING,
      password: DataTypes.STRING,
      isPrivate: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
    },
    {
      sequelize,
      modelName: "User",
    }
  );
  return User;
};
```
