### Instagram Overview
Instagram is based on the real web-based Instagram site, focused on helping connect people and share photos and videos!
</br>
</br>
The front end was built using HTML, CSS, and the Pug library, while the back end was developed using the Sequelize.js ORM, and PostgreSQL.
</br>
</br>
Users can look at all of the pictures they have posted, the ones their friends have in the main feed, and leave comments if they wish.
